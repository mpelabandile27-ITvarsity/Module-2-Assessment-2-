            <P>Gucci is a luxury brand of fashion house based in Florence, Italy. Its product lines include handbags, ready-to-wear, shoes and accessories, makeup, fragrances, and home decoration. Gucci was founded in 1921 by Guccio Gucci in Florence, Tuscany.As a fashion brand, Gucci puts a level of care in sourcing its raw materials which a consumer is not likely to see in fast fashion. From there, luxury brands like Gucci go to designers who charge a pretty penny to create.</P>
